# Rotate Loader

## Definition

Minimal shape rotating loader is a basic CSS animation, where we will make a loader animation with 3 box shapes, & they will be rotated in the right direction by 180 degrees and rotate back to 0 degree & will keep running for an infinite time period.

## Approach

The following approach will be utilized to create shape rotating loader animation, which is described below:

- Make the loader with a div with the class name loader.

- Make three child span elements for the shape, here we will be making it square-shaped, these are named box.

- Style the parent loader element with display flex and gap between the child element with 0.6rem.

- Style the box, style the width, height, and background color, and add the animation of rotation with an infinite time period.

- Add the animation-delay to the 2nd and 3rd box for a smooth and unique effect.

- Make the keyframes at 50% for the rotation of the boxes to 180 degree.
