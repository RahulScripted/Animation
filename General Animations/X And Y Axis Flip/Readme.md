# X & Y Axis Flip

## Definition

The flip animation is the kind of loading animation in which we use a square flip effect to give the feel of loading animation. These kinds of animations are useful in times when the content of the website is taking too long to load. 

## HTML

Create a HTML file and create a div in it.

## CSS

- In CSS, the first thing that we have done is provide a background to the body. Apply background to the div and some border-radius to have a rounded corner.

- Apply linear animation with identifier named as animate. Using key-frames we will apply animation to our identifier.

- We are rotating are square along X-axis during the first half frames and along Y-axis during rest.
