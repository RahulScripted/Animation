# Text Animation

## Definition

Ghost Text Animation can be used to give your website a spooky heading or sub-heading, this effect can be easily created using some simple HTML and CSS.

## HTML

In this section we have a ul tag which consists of some li tags displaying some text.

## CSS

In this section we design the ul element using some basic CSS properties and then in order to create the ghost animation first we will use the filter property which is used to give some visual effects to the respective element and then use the <h2>blur()</h2> Function to provide a blur effect to the text, Further we will use the <h2>nth-child()</h2> Selector to provide some transmition-delay to the text.
